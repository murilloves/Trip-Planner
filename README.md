# Getting Started with Trip Planner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To get started you just need to have Node JS installed, preferable the most updated version (v.16.13.1) and then run:

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

After that, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode (powered by Jest).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Trip Planner is ready to be deployed!
